# 🧙‍♂️ Invisibility Cloak using OpenCV (Red Color)

A real-time computer vision project that makes **red-colored objects invisible** using a webcam.  
Inspired by Harry Potter’s invisibility cloak and implemented using **Python & OpenCV**.

---

## 📌 How It Works
- Captures a **static background**
- Detects **red color** using HSV color space
- Replaces the red region with the background
- Produces a real-time invisibility effect

---

## ✨ Features
- Real-time webcam processing
- Accurate red color detection (dual HSV range)
- Smooth masking using morphological operations
- Simple keyboard control to stop camera

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

---

## 📦 Requirements
Make sure Python is installed, then install dependencies:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
